Description: This program is designed to do 3 things based upon aa user's choice

1. Read out and print various statistics and attributes including file size, short name, write time and date, of all entries within the root directory of the Fat32 file system
2. Export a user inputted desired file either with a short name or long name depending on which is chosen or used to search with by the user. WIll output no file found if the file is invalid.
3. Quit the program.

This was one of the hardest programming projects I have ever done to date, just wrapping my head around all of it took days on end and the result even though it has some flaws, was worth it. There are definitely things I can improve upon this code,
but for now, this is a decent piece of code. I plan to one day come back to this and optimize it.
