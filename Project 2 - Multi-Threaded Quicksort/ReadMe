Description: This program is designed to test the efficiency and explore ways to maximize efficiency of a specialized hybrid quicksort. This program is designed
to test not only single threaded quicksort, but also shell sort, insertion sort, and various multithreaded quicksort options. The program offers various user options
including  what number the hybrid quicksort switches to a specified alternative sort, whether to use median of three partitioning or normal low pivot choice partitioning, using multithreading or single thread,
and including an EARLY thread before partitioning and multithreaded quicksort.
